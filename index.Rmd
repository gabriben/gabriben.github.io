As part of my Mater in Statistics, I am currently doing an exchange at Columbia University, my home university being KU Leuven. In parallel, I am writing my thesis on the digitization and reconstruction of Kaplan Meier survival curves, involving a Hough transform and the sequential reestimation of numbers at risk given the detected deaths and censoring events. 

This summer I worked at Cytel, where I was trying to derive a mathematical formulation for the conditinoal probability  involved in adaptive clinical trials with compounded outcomes based on the [Finkelstein-Schoenfled Statistic](https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/253/2016/05/joint-rank-sim-1999.pdf).

My CV is available [here](files/Gabriel Benedict.pdf).
